            Uttar Pradesh, the heart of India, is a land of epics, holy rivers,
            ancient cities and pilgrimage. In modern times, it is emerging as a
            driver of the nation's economy with its network of expressways,
            industrial corridors, international airports, centers of educational
            and medical excellence, and an exporter of indigenous products.
            Since the times of Lord Rama, Lord Krishna, Gautam Buddha and Lord
            Mahavira, the state has been the center of cultural and intellectual
            brilliance. Today, with its robust infrastructure and a proactive
            leadership, the state offers the most investor friendly environment
            for a better future for its people and the entire country.
